00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.059
Let's take a moment to think about your morning

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.820
The alarm on your phone goes off at 7:03

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.360
you drag yourself to the shower

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.080
and blast yourself with perfectly warm water in an attempt to wake up.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.420
You smear your toothbrush with too much toothpaste

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.140
and scrub yourself into a foamy mess of minty freshness.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
You're running late, so you skate downtown

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.880
weaving through the commuters, dart across the road

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.420
barely making the lights and jump on the train just before the doors beep shut.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.920
There's a couple of stops to go so you pull out your

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.200
phone and play a few games of Angry Birds.

12
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.700
alarms, trains, traffic lights

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.340
video games, toothpaste.

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.380
All these things were made possible by engineers.

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.800
But what prompts an engineer to improve
our world?

16
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.090
Well, they solve problems.

17
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360
Problems are an engineer's inspiration

18
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.560
and maths and science are the creative tools they use to solve them.

19
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.079
Problems like making your
alarm go off at the right time,

20
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.180
or making sure your toothpaste is
just the right balance of chemicals

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.560
to give you that perfect smile.

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140
Or even making a game so addictive it's
almost impossible to put down,

23
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.350
if that really is a problem.

24
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.080
Now let's head over to the airport and jump on an aeroplane.

25
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.900
Ahh aeroplanes, they're so easy to take for
granted.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.479
But don't forget, you can fly!

27
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.860
Before aeroplanes, flying was quite a bit more challenging.

28
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.180
Every bit of your plane has been touched by engineers.

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980
 A mechanical engineer designed the engine,

30
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.320
a mechatronics engineer devised the controls,

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
the fuel? Extracted by mining engineers

32
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.470
and refined by chemical engineers.

33
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260
The navigation systems?

34
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.300
Electrical and software engineers created those.

35
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.720
Yep, a whole team of engineers.

36
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.500
Now we've landed in Dubai,

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.040
home of the Burj Khalifa.

38
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.260
It's the world's tallest building at 829.8 meters high.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.460
It's also in one of the world's hottest environments,

40
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.680
reaching up to 50 degrees in summer.

41
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.360
One of the difficulties of building the Burj 

42
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.220
was trying to figure out how to set forty-five thousand

43
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.040
cubic meters of reinforced concrete in such extreme weather.

44
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.460
The solution?

45
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.680
 A clever method of pumping iced liquid concrete

46
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.800
into the 55,000 tonnes steel frame during the night.

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.180
The result?

48
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.660
A building that's vertically over 800 meters high,

49
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.520
rather than horizontally all over the ground.

50
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200
Now let's jump into our time machine and go back to Saturday,

51
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.560
Saturday March 1932.

52
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.320
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is about to open.

53
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.090
the bridge is a marvel of civil engineering,

54
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.630
and a pretty cool place to set off some fireworks.

55
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.760
Since 1815 people had been talking about building a bridge

56
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180
to connect the two sides of the Harbour.

57
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.580
The problem was that the harbour was so incredibly wide,

58
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.720
how could a bridge span such a width and support its own weight?

59
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.100
The solution?

60
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.440
The Romans!

61
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.660
Well actually it was an idea they came up with.

62
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.260
The arched bridge works by transferring the weight into horizontal forces,

63
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.640
and bracing them at the ends of the arch.

64
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.360
But what about the future?

65
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480
What problems will engineers solve next?

66
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.100
Will we finally have affordable solar power?

67
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Or robots that can perform life-saving surgery,

68
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.300
or a building that's so tall your view is of outer space.

69
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.780
Or how about finally engineering a working hover board?

70
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.060
Seriously, we've waited long enough.

71
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.340
So what is engineering?

72
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.040
It's solving problems.

73
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.420
It's taking crazy, out there ideas

74
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.480
and seeing if they're actually possible.

75
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.160
And when they are, the idea is shared with the world to make all our lives better

76
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.840
So, what problems do you want to solve?
